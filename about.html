		<h2>Basic Design</h2>
		<p>This site has a consistent color scheme throughout as well as a consistent font  which both compliment the topic. This site features a custom logo which adjusts via media queries. On top of this, the navigation, layout, and pictures adjust with the screen size to make the site more dynamic.</p>
		<h2>Organization of Information</h2>
		<p>The content on this page is split up into a main-article and a side-article. Each page has a picture of the location it features, as well as headers to identify the topics covered. This format is applied to every page. </p>
		<h2>Content</h2>
		<p>Content is all origin and was created for this site. All pages have enough information to keep a reader interested without seeming crowded or requiring a huge time commitment for the user. Content is thoughtful and thorough.</p>
		<h2>Navigation</h2>
		<p>Every page of this site is accessible through the global navigation, except the "About" page which is located in the footer. The navigation resizes with the screen size, fits with the site's color scheme, and avoids being too crowded with dropdown links.</p>
		<h2>HTML5 and CSS</h2>
		<p>Elements are broken into classes for styles to be applied. Duplicate code is kept to a minimum with shtml and grouping in the CSS. Elements are formated with padding and margins. The pages cleanly alter as the screen size changes. The site contains the necessary 10 pages and an about page. The site validates. </p>
