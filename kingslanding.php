		<p class="large-first-letter">One of the most prominent tourist attractions in Westeros, King's Landing is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms. A huge city full of history and culture, I still find new things to see, do, and eat every time I visit. This city is located in the south of the continent, and so remains quite warm even in the decade-long winters. It is the home of the king's famous Iron Throne and castle, the Red Keep. Life in King's Landing is mostly luxurious (excluding Flea Bottom of course), and you will encounter a wide variety of people from this continent and beyond. One of the main reasons it's a favorite of mine is the fact that the city has miles of tunnel systems underneath -many of which are uncharted.</p>

		<h2>The Great Sept of Baelor</h2>
		<p class="large-first-letter">The Great Sept of Baelor is the largest building in the city and the center of the Faith of the Seven, the largest religion of the realm. The Great Sept features beautiful, intricately carved likenesses of the seven Gods, elaborate decorations and carvings throughout, and miles of tunnels and dungeons to explore.</p>
