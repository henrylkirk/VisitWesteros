		<h1>SUNSPEAR</h1>
		<p>Sunspear is the home of House Martell and the capital of Dorne, an enormous kingdom taking up the south of Westeros. Dorne, being so far south, is the hottest area of Westeros. It features huge mountains, rocky terrain, and the only desert on the continent. Dorne is famous for its luxurious products, especially its wine.</p>
		<br />
		<p>One of the most popular attractions in Sunspear is the Water Gardens. As you can probably tell by the name, the Water Gardens are a collection of beaches, fountains, and pools which the wealthy and royalty of Dorne go for recreation. This is an excellent destination to cool off after a hot day out in the desert.</p>

		<h2>ACTIVITIES</h2>
		<p>Being in a desert, there are endless events and activities to take part in when you visit. One of my personal favorites is when people from all different houses come together to do camel racing. While they may look ridiculous with their awkward appearance and long legs, camels can run at incredible speeds. If you want a more intense visit, you can hike through the deserts --just watch out for the sand snakes! </p>
