		<h1>THE WALL</h1>
		<p>The Wall is a huge barrier of magic and ice that stretches across the north of the continent, separating it from the wilderness that lies beyond. The Wall, which is several hundred feet high, protects the realm from the Wildlings and White Walkers that live on the other side. The Wall, being so far north, has the most extreme cold of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Being such a dangerous and unforgiving land, The Wall is a destination for only the most experienced of travellers! However, those that manage to journey there can attest to the sheer scale of the structure: I couldn't even see the top! If you brave the journey like I did, I recommend visiting Castle Black. There, the Night's Watch maintains a lift to take people to the top of The Wall. From there, you will see breathtaking views: a snowy landscape stretching on seemingly endlessly, a beautiful evergreen forest, and snowcapped mountains. If you're lucky, you may even see a giant, grumpkin, or snark!</p>

			<h2>NIGHT'S WATCH</h2>
			<p>The Night's Watch is a sworn brotherhood which guards The Wall. Supposedly founded thousands of years ago, the Watch protects the realm from Wildlings, giants, and White Walkers. They are sworn to never marry, never have children, and they can never abandon their post. They control a number of castles along The Wall. Their headquarters is Castle Black, which lies at the northern end of the kingsroad. Once a respected order, their ranks are now mostly made up of prisoners given the choice to remain in prison or "take the black."</p>
